Patterns read from the command line for those commands that support them,Patterns read from a .gitignore file in the same directory as the path, or in any parent directory (up to the top-level of the working tree), with patterns in the higher level files being overridden by those in lower level files down to the directory containing the file. These patterns match relative to the location of the .gitignore file. A project normally includes such .gitignore files in its repository, containing patterns for files generated as part of the project build,Patterns read from the file specified by the configuration variable core.excludesFile.

Which file to place a pattern in depends on how the pattern is meant to be used
